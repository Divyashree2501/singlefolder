Sure! Here's a sample self-introduction you can use during an interview:

"Hello, my name is [Your Name]. I have around 1 year and 8 months of experience in the IT industry, specifically in design, development, 
testing, implementation, and support of new software using .NET Framework technologies, Microsoft SQL Server, and Visual Studio Code.

In my previous role, I worked on a Dealership Management System called AdvantageTVS.
 This software was used to manage all online activities by dealers and handle customer information and services for vehicles produced by TVS. Some of my responsibilities 
included developing an insurance system in Angular to handle online insurance payments for 2-wheelers, 
creating a screen for parts storage location to help dealers identify the location of parts and materials, 
maintaining subledgers for dealers, and developing and consuming web services for lead generation and distribution.

I also worked on an Inspection and Measurement Handling System developed in Angular and WebAPI. This application allowed QAD users to upload 'NOT OK' parts,
 which would then be corrected and forwarded to the manager for approval. My responsibilities for this project included developing the system, data binding using WebAPI, 
fetching data from SQL Server, implementing an auto-mail trigger using a console application, performing manual testing, and providing production support.

I have experience working with technologies such as .NET Framework 4.0, Angular, ASP.NET 4.0, CSS, HTML, SQL Server 2014, and Visual Studio 2019.

I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team with my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and attention to detail. I am eager to take on new challenges and learn from experienced professionals in a collaborative environment.

Thank you for considering my application, and I am excited about the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with the needs of your organization."
